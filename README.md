# ðŸ§  Fall Detection using YOLOv8-OBB + MediaPipe Pose

This project detects human falls in real-time by combining **YOLOv8 Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)** with **MediaPipe Pose Estimation**. It verifies fall predictions based on the **spine angle**, minimizing false alarms.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Real-time fall detection using YOLOv8-OBB.
- âœ… Human posture verification using MediaPipe Pose.
- âœ… Spine angle calculation to confirm falls.
- âœ… Distinguishes between `Fall`, `False Alarm`, and `Non-fall`.
- âœ… Bounding boxes labeled accordingly on each detection.

## ðŸ“¸ Sample Output

- `Fall`: Detected by YOLOv8 and confirmed by abnormal spine angle.
- `False Alarm`: YOLOv8 detects a fall, but spine angle is normal.
- `Non-fall`: Normal human activity.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **YOLOv8-OBB** predicts bounding boxes and labels (e.g., "fall", "bending").
2. **MediaPipe Pose** detects key landmarks on the human body.
3. **Spine angle** is computed using shoulder and hip landmarks.
4. Final decision is:
   - `Fall` â†’ YOLO label is "fall" **AND** spine angle is unnatural.
   - `False Alarm` â†’ YOLO label is "fall" **BUT** posture is normal.
   - `Non-fall` â†’ Any other prediction.

## ðŸ§® Spine Angle Logic

- Calculates the angle between the **mid-shoulder** and **mid-hip** line.
- If spine is nearly horizontal (`< 45Â° or > 135Â°`) and the vertical distance is low â†’ **unnatural posture**.
